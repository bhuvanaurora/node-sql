A lightweight MySQL ORM for Node.js.

Motivation:
I have been working with NoSQL databases for quite a while, but when the need arose for working with MySQL, I could not find a lightweight ORM for connecting with the DB. Most of the ORMs out there were quite bloated and native driver doesn't serve the purpose for a large-scale application. Native driver makes the code messy with raw SQL queries being thrown around or you fetching all the information and processing on the server which is highly inefficient. Hence the ORM.
